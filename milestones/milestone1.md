## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
During this unit, we effectively collaborated and brainstormed ideas for our recipe app project. We were able to define the core features and user stories, which provided a clear direction for our development process. We have also found a way to communicate outside of class and have a clear process for how to work on this project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One of the challenges we faced was trying to come up with some features within our app and establish how we would start off with it. Another challenge, was trying to come up with some of the user stories since we had to come up with 10 it was a little difficult, but we managed to come up with it.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
Some additional support would be feedback and guidance from our ta to see if we are heading in the right direction. Also, if we were to stumble on some bugs or having
problems implementing a feature of how to go about it we need assistance on this as well.
