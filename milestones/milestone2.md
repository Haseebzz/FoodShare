## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, we met each other on Tuesday to discuss and give feedback about the wireframe and the entity relational diagram. We both agree with the solutions we have so far.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the challenges we faced was trying to figure out the relationship between entities and listing which entities are neccessary for the app. The hardest one was trying to make at least one multiple-multiple relationship. However, we finally complete it.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Some additional support would be feedback and guidance from our TA to see if we are heading in the right direction. Also, we need to confirm about our wireframe and entity relationship diagram.
