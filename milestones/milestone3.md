## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We learned how to create board and plan ahead issues need to complete. That's a part of Agile process and we get a chance to go through it.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We have some challenges when trying to break down features into small pieces and write desscription for them, but eventually it went pretty well.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We all agree that this week is used to design and sketch out more specific for the UI before go ahead and implement, so we will start solving issues next week. We will prioritize the basic UI that supports the required features and focus on the backend and database.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The comment feature is maybe optional but we will try our best to have it in the app.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We believe we're good now, it would be great if we go through authentication and passport.js.
