## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
What went well is that we have successfully finished our app and have implemented all the desired features that we were aiming for as well as having a well-deployed link to it.
### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
One challenge we faced was trying to use passport.js for authentication so instead we decided to use jwt instead which worked out pretty well. Also, for development issues, we had some problems when we were trying to deploy it on the railway so we decided to use Vercel as an alternative hosting site which worked out well. We had some issues deploying on vercel, but we managed to solve them which had something to do with the backend.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?
We had some issues deploying our website on Vercel as well and debugging the issue was something that we were proud of because it took us a day to solve our issue. We learned that reading the error logs is very important because it tells you exactly what's wrong and googling and researching the problem was quite the process. Having this problem solved will allow us to have a better understanding when deploying apps if there are any errors to it.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?
We have grown a lot and learned a lot of interesting web development concepts such as controllers, routes, how to build a backend using Postgresql, authentication, and deployment which has helped us understand the web better and made us better programmers. Furthermore, we believe that this course has made us better debuggers and know how to fix errors in solving problems.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?
Our goals related to web development are to keep on practicing and learning new concepts by building new projects and learning different tech stacks relating to them and how it interact with the web. Another goal we have is to become better web developers and practicing daily will help us ensure our goals.
